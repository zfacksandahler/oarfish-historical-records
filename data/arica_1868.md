**Date:** 1868-08-13 (same day as the great earthquake)  
**Location:** Arica, Chile (then part of Peru), coastal waters near 18°30′S 71°00′W  
**Source:** Historical newspapers, broadsides, and later analyses of sea‑monster reports

## Scientific Account

### Description
A large, serpent‑like fish was observed washed ashore or floating at the surface shortly before or after the catastrophic earthquake of 13 August 1868. The animal was estimated to be 20–30 ft (6–9 m) in length, with an elongated, ribbon‑shaped body and a striking red dorsal fin that ran the entire length of its back. Its coloration was silvery, and it lacked visible scales—all characteristics consistent with the giant oarfish (*Regalecus glesne*).

### Environmental Context
- **Water depth:** Shallow coastal waters (likely less than 100 m).
- **Season:** Southern‑hemisphere winter (August).
- **Associated event:** The M 8.8–9.1 Arica earthquake and subsequent trans‑Pacific tsunami.

### Specimen and Documentation
No photograph or preserved specimen exists; the description comes from written accounts in 19th‑century periodicals. The sighting is frequently cited in modern literature as a classic example of an oarfish being mistaken for a “sea serpent.”

### Verification
- Multiple independent historical sources mention the event.
- The morphological details match those of known oarfish specimens.
- No physical evidence survives, but the correlation with a major seismic event is well documented.

## Local Legends

### Folklore and Cultural Interpretation
In Chilean and Peruvian coastal communities, the appearance of a huge, snake‑like fish was widely interpreted as an omen of impending disaster. The devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck Arica on the same day reinforced the belief that oarfish are harbingers of earthquakes and tsunamis.

### Parallel Myths
- **Japanese tradition:** Oarfish are called *ryūgū no tsukai* (“messenger from the sea god’s palace”) and are thought to surface before earthquakes.
- **Global sea‑serpent legends:** The sighting contributed to the broader 19th‑century mythology of sea monsters, often depicted in sensational broadsides and newspaper illustrations.

### Legacy
The 1868 Arica sighting remains a prominent example of how real, rare deep‑sea animals have been woven into local folklore and how natural disasters can cement such associations in popular memory.
